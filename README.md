Analyzing DVD rental data



In this project I analyzed the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. The aim was to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. 
I defined 4 questions and built the code around these, afterwards created visuals to demonstrate the findings.
